    <string name="articleSubtitle">Behind That Locked Door: Beatles Rarities!</string>
    <string name="articleText">In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London — protected by an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door — are something like 400 hours of unreleased Beatles recordings, starting from June 2, 1962 and ending with the very last tracks recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album. The best of the best were released by Apple Records in the form of the 3-volume Anthology series.

\n\n
This volume starts with the first new Beatle song, “Free as a Bird” (based on a John Lennon demo, found only on <i>The Lost Lennon Tapes Vol. 28</i>, and covers the very earliest historical recordings, outtakes from the first albums, and live recordings from early concerts and BBC Radio sessions.
\n\n
<b>Highlights include:</b>
\n\n
<b><i>Cry for a Shadow</i></b> - Many a Beatle fanatic started down the outtake road, like I did, with a first listen to this song. Originally titled “Beatle Bop” and recorded in a single session that yielded four songs (the other three featured Tony Sheridan with the Beatles as a backing band), “Cry for a Shadow” is an instrumental written by Lennon and Harrison, which makes it unique to this day. John Lennon plays rhythm guitar, George Harrison plays lead guitar, Paul McCartney plays bass, and Pete Best plays drums. The sessions were produced by Bert Kaempfert in Hamburg, Germany, during the Beatles’ second visit from April through July of 1961 to play in the Reeperbahn-section clubs.
\n\n
<b><i>My Bonnie</i></b> and <b><i>Ain’t She Sweet</i></b> — At the same session, the Beatles played on “My Bonnie” (the first-ever single with Beatles playing), as the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan, originally a member of the Jets. The popularity of this single in Liverpool brought the Beatles to the attention of Brian Epstein, who worked in the NEMS record store and tried to meet demand for the disc. John Lennon then sings a fine “Ain’t She Sweet” (his first-ever released vocal).
\n\n
<b><i>Searchin</i></b> — A Jerry Leiber - Mike Stoller comedy song that was a hit for the Coasters in 1957, and a popular live favorite of the Beatles. The Coasters also had a hit with “Besame Mucho” and the Beatles covered that song as well. Ringo Starr had by now replaced Pete Best on drums. The high falsetto is George, who also plays a hesitant lead guitar. This is from their first audition for Decca Records in London on Jan 1., 1962, live in the studio. The Grateful Dead would later cover “Searchin” with a similar arrangement, Pigpen doing the Paul vocals. A live version is available on outtake records featuring the Dead joined by the Beach Boys!
\n\n
<b><i>Love Me Do</i></b> — An early version of the song, played a bit slower and with more of a blues feeling, and a cool bossa-nova beat in middle. Paul had to sing while John played harmonica — a first for the group. Pete Best played drums on this version.
\n\n
<b><i>She Loves You – Till There Was You – Twist and Shout</i></b> — Live at the Princess Wales Theatre by Leicester Square in London, attended by the Queen. “Till There Was You” (by Meredith Wilson) is from the musical The Music Man and a hit for Peggy Lee in 1961. Before playing it, Paul said it was recorded by his favorite American group, “Sophie Tucker” (which got some laughs). At the end, John tells the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands, and the rest to “rattle your jewelry” and then announces “Twist and Shout” (a song by Bert Russell and Phil Medley that was first recorded in 1962 by the Isley Brothers). A film of the performance shows the Queen smiling at John’s remark.
\n\n
<b><i>Leave My Kitten Alone</i></b> — One of the lost Beatle songs recorded during the “Beatles For Sale” sessions but never released. This song, written by Little Willie John, Titus Turner, and James McDougal, was a 1959 R&amp;B hit for Little Willie John and covered by Johnny Preston before the Beatles tried it and shelved it. A reference to a “big fat bulldog” may have influenced John’s “Hey Bulldog” (Yellow Submarine album), which is a similar rocker.
\n\n
<b><i>One After 909</i></b> — A song recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album was actually worked on way back in the beginning, six years earlier. This take shows how they did it much more slowly, with an R&amp;B feel to it.

    <!--<string name="articleSubtitle">The Chelsea players are currently midway through a break from training following the game in the United States and ahead of our big Europa League final London derby against Arsenal.</string>-->
    <!--<string name="articleText">Two of our experienced defenders have discussed having a two-week gap between games ahead of such an-important climax to the season.-->
<!--Marcos Alonso will be in the squad for a European final for the first time.-->

<!--‘We have a couple of days to rest now but of course we will be with our head in the game so there will be a little bit of light training and then in two days we are back to full training to be ready for the final,’ the left-back said.-->

<!--‘A final for a European title, it is massive for us,’ he added, ‘and we will try to prepare 120 per cent and try to bring the trophy back to London.’-->

<!--The 28-year-old also looked back on the match in Boston – the Final Whistle on Hate game against New England Revolution.-->

<!--‘It was good. The main thing was to try to make an impact on people around the world, to say there should be no discrimination, no antisemitism and we should not tolerate these kind of things. If we can help as we did on this trip we are pleased to do it and I hope we made the impact we wanted.’-->




<!--Cesar Azpilicueta was part of the Chelsea side which won the Europa League in 2013, at the end of his first season as one of our players, and he is looking forward to the chance to lift the trophy for a second time.-->

<!--He saw Wednesday’s win in America as a step in the process.-->

<!--‘It was our last game before the final and from the second minute we were leading in the game and so that made things easier,’ he said. ‘We wanted to have good feelings before the final. We had a great time out there, we had great support and saw again our fans here.-->

<!--‘We are happy to see them again, it has been three years since the last time we were in the United States and hopefully we can see them again soon.-->

<!--‘It is nearly two weeks until the final and we will have plenty of time to train hard and have some rest,’ he added. ‘It is very important to arrive in good condition after a long season.’-->
